    <!-- Power Management: Specifies whether to decouple the interactive state of the
         device from the display on/off state.

         When false, setInteractive(..., true) will be called before the display is turned on
         and setInteractive(..., false) will be called after the display is turned off.
         This mode provides best compatibility for devices that expect the interactive
         state to be tied to the display state.

         When true, setInteractive(...) will be called independently of whether the display
         is being turned on or off.  This mode enables the power manager to reduce
         clocks and disable the touch controller while the display is on.

         This resource should be set to "true" when a doze component has been specified
         to maximize power savings but not all devices support it.

         Refer to power.h for details.

    <!-- Specifies whether the dreams feature should be supported.
         When true, the system will allow the user to configure dreams (screensavers)
         to launch when a user activity timeout occurs or the system is told to nap.
         When false, the dreams feature will be disabled (this does not affect dozing).

         Consider setting this resource to false or disabling dreams by default when a
         doze component is specified below since dreaming will supercede dozing and
         will prevent the system from entering a low power state until the dream ends. -->
